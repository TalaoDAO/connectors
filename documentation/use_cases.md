# üß† Identity Wallet as MCP Server for AI Agents ‚Äî Core Use Cases 1.0

This document outlines the **primary use cases** of the **MCP Server**, which provides identity, attestations, and wallet services to **AI Agents** in a trusted ecosystem..  

The server enables the issuance, verification, storage, and presentation of **Verifiable Credentials (VCs)** through **decentralized identifiers (DIDs)**, following **Identity Wallet** and **OIDC4VC** standards.

---

## üîê Identity & Authentication

**Use Case #0 ‚Äî Verify user identity via an Identity Wallet**  
An AI Agent or relying service uses the MCP Server to verify a **user‚Äôs decentralized identity** through a verifiable presentation from their compliant wallet.

**Use Case #1 ‚Äî Verify organizational (legal entity) identity**  
The MCP Server validates a company‚Äôs credential (e.g., Legal Entity Identifier or EU business registration) to establish **trusted machine-to-organization communication**.

**Use Case #2 ‚Äî Verify another AI Agent‚Äôs identity**  
When two AI Agents interact, each uses the MCP Server to **authenticate the other** based on verifiable credentials issued under decentralized identifiers (DIDs).

**Use Case #3 ‚Äî AI Agent authenticates to a relying party via the MCP Server**  
An AI Agent uses the MCP Server‚Äôs OIDC4VC endpoint to authenticate itself to a relying party or API service by presenting verifiable credentials from its wallet.

## üßæ Credential Issuance & Delegations

**Use Case #4 ‚Äî Issue a verifiable credential (identity, role, or mandate)**  
The MCP Server issues VCs to AI Agents, users, or organizations ‚Äî such as identity credentials, delegation tokens, or proof-of-role credentials ‚Äî signed by a recognized issuer.

**Use Case #5 ‚Äî Manage and store issued credentials**  
The MCP Server provides a secure storage interface (linked to a wallet) for issued credentials, ensuring accessibility and cryptographic integrity for both AI and human holders.

**Use Case #6 ‚Äî Revoke or update existing credentials**  
An issuer can use the MCP Server to **revoke, suspend, or modify** a previously issued credential, broadcasting the change to verifiers and linked wallets.

---

## üß© Verification & Proof Presentation

**Use Case #7 ‚Äî Verify a credential from any holder**  
A relying service or AI Agent sends a verifiable presentation (VP) to the MCP Server. The server checks signature validity, revocation status, and schema compliance before returning a verification result.

**Use Case #8 ‚Äî Request proof of attributes (selective disclosure)**  
The MCP Server requests **specific attributes** (e.g., "age > 18", "member of consortium") from a holder‚Äôs wallet without revealing unrelated personal data.

**Use Case #9 ‚Äî Perform continuous verification of agent credentials**  
For ongoing trust relationships, the MCP Server regularly verifies active credentials (mandates, compliance proofs, etc.) through automated MCP-based requests.

**Use Case #10 ‚Äî Validate cross-domain or cross-wallet proofs**  
The MCP Server verifies credentials that originate from **different ecosystems** or **trust frameworks**, ensuring interoperability (e.g., between identity Wallet and private trust networks).

---

## üí¨ Data Sharing, Attestations & Provenance

**Use Case #11 ‚Äî Store and share attestations with proof of origin**  
The MCP Server acts as a trusted **attestation registry**, storing issued credentials (e.g., trust scores, certifications, policy proofs) and their associated metadata for retrieval and audit.

**Use Case #12 ‚Äî Enable verifiable data exchange between agents**  
Two AI Agents exchange data through the MCP Server, attaching verifiable proofs (e.g., source certification, timestamp, consent record) to ensure authenticity and provenance.

**Use Case #13 ‚Äî Issue derived attestations from validated credentials**  
After verifying credentials from multiple issuers, the MCP Server can produce **derived credentials** (e.g., ‚Äútrusted supplier‚Äù or ‚Äúcompliant participant‚Äù) based on verified inputs.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Governance, Consent & Compliance

**Use Case #14 ‚Äî Manage consent credentials**  
The MCP Server supports the issuance and verification of **verifiable consent tokens**, allowing users to grant and revoke permissions for data processing or delegation.

**Use Case #15 ‚Äî Provide verifiable compliance proofs**  
Organizations use the MCP Server to generate and verify credentials that prove compliance with frameworks like **AI Act**, **GDPR**, or **ISO standards**.

**Use Case #16 ‚Äî Maintain audit logs and verifiable transaction history**  
The MCP Server produces cryptographically signed audit trails of credential issuance, verification, and presentation ‚Äî enabling **accountability and traceability** across AI interactions.

---

## üß† Advanced Integration & Interoperability

**Use Case #17 ‚Äî Integrate AI agents into decentralized identity ecosystems**  
Developers use the MCP Server as a backend component for agents to interact with wallets, W3C VC, and OIDC4VC-compatible ecosystems, enabling **cross-wallet interoperability**.

**Use Case #18 ‚Äî Enable multi-agent collaboration through verified roles**  
The MCP Server issues role-based credentials to participating agents (e.g., ‚Äúnegotiator‚Äù, ‚Äúexecutor‚Äù), facilitating **trusted cooperation** in decentralized workflows.
